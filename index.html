        <h3>The Transition</h3>
        <section>
          <h4>My Background</h4>
    <p>My name is Kahelia Spencer. Born in Seattle and raised in Atlanta during my younger years. I found myself working in coffee and bakery shops,<br>which made me have a passion for the art detail from decorating and "plating". This led me to enroll in culiinary school to get an education on food all over the world and the technique used for most cuisines.</p>
    <p>Today, I have a meal prep and private catering business and recently enrolled into Thinkful to gain a new skill I knew I would also enjoy, <br>Computer Programming. To me, the 2 industries focus on detail oriented tasks, which makes me excited to learn more about. Though, one is a more secure and promissing<br> position for the tech city I live in, Seattle, WA. Known to house some of the best tech companies you hear about and use daily.</p>
